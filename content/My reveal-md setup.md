## Prerequisites

### content

This directory is used to store Markdown files.

The `attachments` subdirectory is used to store images, videos, etc.

----

### docs

This directory is used to store generated HTML files, and GitHub will use them to build the site.

----

### gitignore

Nothing special.

----

### Makefile

Just for convenience.

Btw, I prefer `white` theme and `monokai-sublime` highlight theme.

### reveal-md.json

Default configurations for reveal-md.

## Workflow

1. Create a new Markdown file in `content` and write something (attachments should be added to `attachments`).
2. Execute `make preview` and open [http://localhost:1948](http://localhost:1948) to preview the presentation (modify it if needed).
3. Execute `make generate` and open `docs/index.html` to see the generated HTML.
4. Use `git` commands to push all the changes to GitHub.
5. Wait for a few seconds and then open the [GitHub Page site](https://hezhizhen.github.io/slides) to view the presentation online.
